A protocol for information dissemination.

* Overview
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: overview
  :END:
- server :: computational environment capable of housing points and
     communicating messages

- points :: communicating entity, including
  - an address URI (possibly also a name)
  - a public key for encryption and verification

- messages :: data sent between a single point and a set of points.
  - public message :: single point to the null set i.e. everyone
  - single message :: single point to single point

* Needs
** encryption
** signing
** distributed keyword search
** distributed tables
e.g., for association of
- user names with URIs
- see if a copy of twitter's schema is available online
- more...

** distributed message dissemination
like email

** mime
will need to allow multipart messages
- being as similar as email would be good
- learning from email would also be good

* Tools
- PGP for the signing, verification, encryption and decryption of all
  messages
- I know there are distributed search engine implementations

** Use cases
- some from links at [[id:e6e05b9e-651a-4ab9-9ca8-bf7728f8278d][RFC twitter-like API]]
- similar to
  - twitter style information dissemination
  - social information posting and reading

*** find a feed
just use web pages, or integrate into the spec

*** listing microblogs
will need some sort of title, meta-information or summary
(note: meta-information gathering is a common form of warentless surveillance)

*** subscribing
*** replies
*** keyword searching
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: keyword-searching
    :END:

*** hashtags
Apparently these arose organically from the keyword search mechanisms
built into twitter.  So it would seem that this is simply a subset of
[[#keyword-searching]].

Clients may make these clickable on their own.

*** direct addressing
- some form of universal addressing (see [[#overview]] points)
- likely some need for abbreviated names or distributed table linking
  names to URIs

*** CLI friendly
e.g., cat a remote resource and pipe the result into a program.
: cat friend:some/movies.mov|mplayer
** how to identify sub-point resources
e.g., how can I browse the messages available from some end point.
- file system?
- temporal feed?
- must respect the groups and permissions set by that end point
