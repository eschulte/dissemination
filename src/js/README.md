A System for distributed information dissemination
--------------------------------------------------

A distributed system for the dissemination of messages.  The
core of the system is a loose network of servers which share
messages  similar  in  architecture to Usenet.  Messages are
serialized as JSON hashes.  Messages are signed or encrypted
using  GPG  public  and private keys.  The primary goals are
simplicity, security, privacy, and robust operation.
